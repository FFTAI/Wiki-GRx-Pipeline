![](pictures/7.png)

This repository provides a guidance for training Fourier Intelligence GRx series robot to walk on rough terrain using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Anaconda
- NVIDIA GPU (Prefer GPU powerful than GTX 3060)
- NVIDIA Driver with CUDA higher than 11.0
- Python 3.8
- Isaac Gym
- legged_gym
- rsl_rl

## Pipeline

The pipeline of training Fourier Intelligence GRx series robot to walk on rough terrain can be divided into the following steps:

1. **Prepare** robot model:
    - **URDF**:
        - [Wiki-GRx-Models](https://github.com/FFTAI/wiki-grx-models)
        - This repository provides the GRx series robot models in URDF format.
    - **MJCF**:
        - [Wiki-MJCF](https://github.com/FFTAI/wiki-mjcf)
        - This repository provides the MJCF format robot models for training in MuJoCo.

2. **Train** walking policy:
    - **Isaac Gym**:
        - [Wiki-GRx-Gym](https://github.com/FFTAI/wiki-grx-gym)
        - This repository provides the code for training walking policy for GRx in Isaac Gym.

3. **Verify** in simulator with ODE physics engine:
    - **Webots**:
        - [Wiki-GRx-Webots](https://github.com/FFTAI/wiki-grx-webots)
        - This repository provides the code for verifying the walking policy in the Webots simulator with ODE physics engine.
    - **Gazebo**:
        - [Wiki-GRx-Gazebo](https://github.com/FFTAI/wiki-grx-gazebo)
        - This repository provides the code for verifying the walking policy in the Gazebo simulator with ODE physics engine.

4. **Deploy** on real robot ðŸ¤–:
    - [Wiki-GRx-Deploy](https://github.com/FFTAI/wiki-grx-deploy)
    - This repository provides the code for deploying the walking policy on the real robot.
